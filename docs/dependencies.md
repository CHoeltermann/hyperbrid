# Dependencies

* fastp (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)
	* could be shipped via singularity: https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/bioconductor-rfastp%3A1.8.0--r42hf17093f_1
	* this is the same way that nf-core rna seq pipeline uses fastp. I intend to learn how to do that by using them as an example.
	* module load singularity/3.7.4
