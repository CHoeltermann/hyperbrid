Pipeline to investigate hybridization in primate genomes, utilizing various tools and software.

It is currently unfinished, but I will continue working on it, given the time.


I included two scripts from different tools I used in my code:

1. from mosdepth

-- Script was taken from github.com/brentp/mosdepth
-- all rights with Brent S. Pedersen et al. (Publication: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx699)

2. from vcf2phylip

-- script was taken from github.com/edgardomortiz/vcf2phylip
-- all rights with Edgardo M. Ortiz and Juan D. Palacio-Mej√≠a (Publication: Ortiz, E.M. 2019. vcf2phylip v2.0: convert a VCF matrix into several matrix formats for phylogenetic analysis. DOI:10.5281/zenodo.2540861)
